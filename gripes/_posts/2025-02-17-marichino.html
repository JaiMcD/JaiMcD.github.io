        <p class="fauna-one">
            Unlike foods which may be unpleasant due to taste, texture or smell, maraschino cherries occupy a rarely seen space of being unpleasant simply due to their application. 
            For all you maraschino cherry stans out there, let me quote to you the second sentence of their wikipedia article:<br>

            <span class="playfair-i">In their modern form, the cherries are first preserved in a brine solution usually containing sulfur dioxide and calcium chloride to bleach the fruit, then soaked in a suspension of food coloring (common red food dye is FD&C Red 40), sugar syrup, and other components.</span><br>

            This is enough for me to stay far, far away from them in my drinks. Yet some companies have the <span class="playfair-i">audacity</span> to market something as cherry flavoured, and then use maraschino cherry flavouring! This is never what I order, nor what I would need. Imagine you're excited for a nice, refreshing cucumber drink and what you receive is a pickle flavoured drink! It is not talked about enough.
